# Safety Features

This document outlines the safety features that will be implemented in the Visual Approval Dashboard to prevent accidental actions and provide a safety net for users.

## 1. Preview Mode

*   **"What you see is what you get" (WYSIWYG) Diff Viewer:** The diff viewer will clearly and accurately represent the changes in a pull request before any action is taken.
*   **Simulated Merge:** Before approving a merge, the user will be able to see a preview of the final merged code, including how conflicts (if any) would be resolved.

## 2. Confirmation Dialogs

*   **Destructive Actions:** All destructive actions, such as rejecting a pull request or deleting a branch, will trigger a confirmation dialog.
*   **Clear Language:** The dialog will use clear and unambiguous language to explain the consequences of the action. For example, "Are you sure you want to reject this pull request? This action cannot be undone."

## 3. Rollback and Undo Options

*   **Revertible Actions:** For actions that can be undone (e.g., approving a pull request that hasn't been merged yet), an "undo" option will be available for a short period of time.
*   **Revert Commits:** After a pull request has been merged, the user will be guided on how to revert the merge commit if necessary.

## 4. Error Handling and Recovery

*   **Graceful Error Handling:** The application will handle API errors and other unexpected issues gracefully, providing informative error messages to the user.
*   **Automatic Retries:** For transient network errors, the application will automatically retry failed requests.
*   **Offline Support:** The application will cache data to provide limited functionality even when the user is offline.
