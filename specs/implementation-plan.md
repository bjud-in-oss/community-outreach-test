# Implementation Plan

This document outlines the phased implementation plan for the Visual Approval Dashboard.

## Phase 1: Core Functionality and UI

*   **Objective:** Build the basic UI and connect it to a mock API.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Implement the component architecture with real JSX and styling.
    *   Create a mock API that returns realistic data.
    *   Fetch and display the list of pull requests.
    *   Display the details of a selected pull request.
*   **Testing Strategy:**
    *   Unit tests for each component using `React Testing Library`.
    *   Storybook stories for each component to visually test them in isolation.
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   **Risk:** The design is not user-friendly.
    *   **Mitigation:** Conduct user testing with the wireframes and mockups before starting development.

## Phase 2: API Integration and State Management

*   **Objective:** Replace the mock API with a real API and implement state management.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Integrate with the actual backend API.
    *   Implement `React Query` for data fetching and caching.
    *   Implement `React Context` for global UI state.
*   **Testing Strategy:**
    *   Integration tests to verify the interaction between the frontend and backend.
    *   End-to-end tests using `Cypress` to simulate user workflows.
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   **Risk:** The API is not ready or does not meet the requirements.
    *   **Mitigation:** Work closely with the backend team to define the API contract and ensure it is implemented correctly.

## Phase 3: Safety Features and Real-time Updates

*   **Objective:** Implement the safety features and real-time updates.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Implement confirmation dialogs for destructive actions.
    *   Implement the "undo" functionality.
    *   Integrate with a WebSocket service for real-time updates.
*   **Testing Strategy:**
    *   Unit tests for the safety features.
    *   End-to-end tests for the real-time update functionality.
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   **Risk:** The real-time updates are not reliable.
    *   **Mitigation:** Use a robust WebSocket library and implement a fallback mechanism (e.g., polling) in case the WebSocket connection is lost.

## Phase 4: Deployment and Monitoring

*   **Objective:** Deploy the application and set up monitoring.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   Deploy the application to a staging environment for final testing.
    *   Deploy the application to production.
    *   Set up monitoring and alerting to track the health of the application.
*   **Testing Strategy:**
    *   Smoke testing in the production environment.
*   **Risk Mitigation:**
    *   **Risk:** The application has performance issues in production.
    *   **Mitigation:** Use performance monitoring tools to identify and fix bottlenecks.
