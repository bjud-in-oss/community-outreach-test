# Enhanced WYSIWYG Integration Architecture

This document outlines the architecture for an enhanced WYSIWYG editor integrated with the Jules Agent intelligence system.

## 1. Improved Component Library

We will build a library of reusable React components on top of **Slate.js**. This will provide a flexible and extensible foundation for the WYSIWYG editor.

### 1.1. Core Components

*   **`<Editor>`:** The main editor component that wraps the Slate.js editor. It will manage the editor's state, including the document's value and the user's selection.
*   **`<Toolbar>`:** A container for the editor's toolbar. It will be highly configurable, allowing developers to easily add or remove buttons.
*   **`<Button>`:** A generic button component for the toolbar. It will handle the logic for applying marks (e.g., bold, italic) and toggling blocks (e.g., headings, lists).
*   **`<Element>`:** A component for rendering custom elements in the editor. This will be used for things like images, videos, and code blocks.
*   **`<Leaf>`:** A component for rendering custom text formatting. This will be used for things like syntax highlighting and inline spoilers.

### 1.2. State Management

The editor's state will be managed using a combination of React's `useState` and `useReducer` hooks. For more complex state, we will use a state management library like Redux or Zustand. This will ensure that the editor's state is predictable and easy to debug.

### 1.3. Customization

The component library will be designed with customization in mind. Developers will be able to:

*   **Create custom elements and leaves:** This will allow them to extend the editor's functionality to meet their specific needs.
*   **Customize the toolbar:** They will be able to add, remove, or rearrange buttons in the toolbar.
*   **Theme the editor:** They will be able to easily change the editor's appearance to match their application's design.

## 2. Jules Agent API Integration

The WYSIWYG editor will communicate with the Jules Agent through a REST API. This will allow the editor to leverage the agent's intelligence for features like content analysis, code generation, and suggestions.

### 2.1. API Endpoints

*   **`POST /api/jules/analyze`:** Analyzes the current document's content and returns suggestions for improvement.
    *   **Request Body:** `{ "content": "..." }`
    *   **Response Body:** `{ "suggestions": [...] }`
*   **`POST /api/jules/generate/code`:** Generates a code snippet based on the current context.
    *   **Request Body:** `{ "context": "...", "language": "..." }`
    *   **Response Body:** `{ "code": "..." }`
*   **`POST /api/jules/generate/text`:** Generates text based on the current context.
    *   **Request Body:** `{ "context": "..." }`
    *   **Response Body:** `{ "text": "..." }`

### 2.2. Authentication

The API will be secured using a token-based authentication system. The editor will send an API token in the `Authorization` header of each request.

### 2.3. Error Handling

The API will return standard HTTP error codes to indicate the status of each request. The response body will contain a detailed error message.

## 3. Real-time Collaboration Features

We will use WebSockets and Operational Transformation (OT) to enable real-time collaboration. This will allow multiple users to edit the same document simultaneously without conflicts.

### 3.1. Server-side

*   **WebSocket Server:** We will use a Node.js WebSocket server (e.g., using `ws` or `Socket.IO`) to handle real-time communication between the clients.
*   **Document State:** The server will maintain the canonical state of each document.
*   **OT Algorithm:** The server will use an OT algorithm to transform and apply operations from the clients. This will ensure that all clients converge to the same document state.

### 3.2. Client-side

*   **WebSocket Client:** The client will use a WebSocket to connect to the server and send and receive operations.
*   **Local and Remote Operations:** The client will distinguish between local operations (i.e., changes made by the current user) and remote operations (i.e., changes made by other users).
*   **OT Algorithm:** The client will use the same OT algorithm as the server to transform and apply operations. This will ensure that the local document state remains consistent with the server's state.

### 3.3. Conflict Resolution

OT is designed to handle concurrent editing and resolve conflicts automatically. However, in the rare case of a conflict that cannot be resolved by OT, we will implement a simple "last-write-wins" strategy.

## 4. Context-aware Code Generation

The Jules Agent will provide context-aware code generation by analyzing the document's content and the user's intent.

### 4.1. Context Analysis

*   **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** The agent will use NLP techniques to understand the semantics of the text surrounding the cursor. This will include identifying keywords, entities, and the overall topic of the document.
*   **Cursor Position:** The agent will consider the cursor's position within the document's structure (e.g., inside a list, a code block, or a table).
*   **User's Intent:** The agent will try to infer the user's intent based on the text they have written. For example, if the user writes "create a function that takes two numbers and returns their sum," the agent will know that the user wants to generate a function.

### 4.2. Code Generation

*   **Large Language Models (LLMs):** The agent will use a large language model to generate code snippets based on the context analysis.
*   **Language-specific Generators:** The agent will have language-specific generators for popular programming languages. This will ensure that the generated code is syntactically correct and follows best practices.
*   **User Feedback:** The agent will learn from user feedback to improve the quality of its code generation. If the user accepts a suggestion, the agent will know that it was a good suggestion. If the user rejects a suggestion, the agent will know that it was a bad suggestion.

## 5. Visual-to-code Synchronization

We will implement a two-way data binding mechanism to keep the visual representation of the document in sync with the underlying code.

### 5.1. Serialization

*   **Slate to Markdown:** We will create a function that serializes the Slate.js document to Markdown. This will allow us to store the document in a human-readable format.
*   **Custom JSON Format:** For more complex documents, we will use a custom JSON format that can represent all of the features of the editor.

### 5.2. Deserialization

*   **Markdown to Slate:** We will create a function that deserializes a Markdown document into a Slate.js document. This will allow us to load existing Markdown files into the editor.
*   **Custom JSON Format:** We will also create a function that deserializes our custom JSON format into a Slate.js document.

### 5.3. Data Flow

The data will flow in a unidirectional loop:

1.  The user interacts with the editor, which updates the Slate.js document.
2.  The Slate.js document is serialized to Markdown or our custom JSON format.
3.  The serialized document is stored in the application's state.
4.  The application's state is used to render the editor.

This will ensure that the editor is always in sync with the application's state.
