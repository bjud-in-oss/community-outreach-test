## Getting Started

Jules is an experimental coding agent that helps you fix bugs, add documentation, and build new features. It integrates with GitHub, understands your codebase, and works asynchronously ‚Äî so you can move on while it handles the task.

This guide will walk you through setting up Jules and running your first task.

### Login
- Visit jules.google.com
- Sign in with your Google account
- Accept the privacy notice (one‚Äëtime)

### Connect GitHub
Jules needs access to your repositories in order to work.
- Click Connect to GitHub account
- Complete the login flow
- Choose all or specific repos that you want to connect to Jules
- You will be redirected back to Jules. If not, try refreshing the page

Once connected, you'll see a repo selector where you can select the repo you want Jules to work with, and a prompt input box.

### Starting your first task
Jules runs in a virtual machine where it clones your code, installs dependencies, and modifies files.

1. Pick a repository from the repo selector
2. Choose the branch you want Jules to work on. The default branch will be selected already. You do not have to modify this unless you want Jules to work on a specific branch
3. Write a clear, specific prompt. For example, "Add a test for parseQueryString function in utils.js"
4. (Optional) Add environment setup scripts
5. Click "Give me a plan"

Once you submit a task, Jules will generate a plan. You can review and approve it before any code changes are made.

### Include AGENTS.md file
Jules now automatically looks for a file named AGENTS.md in the root of your repository. This file can describe the agents or tools in your codebase, such as what they do, how to interact with them, or any input and output conventions. Jules uses this file to better understand your code and generate more relevant plans and completions.

**Tip:** Keep AGENTS.md up to date. It helps Jules and your teammates work with your repo more effectively.

### Enabling notifications
You are free to leave Jules while it is running. To stay informed:
- When prompted, enable browser notifications
- Go to Settings ‚Äî> notifications at any time to enable or disable notifications
- You'll be notified when the task completes or needs your input

---

## Environment Setup

Jules runs each task inside a secure, short-lived virtual machine (VM). This lets it clone your repository, install dependencies, and run tests.

To make sure Jules can do its job effectively, you can provide setup scripts that prepare the environment.

### What's preinstalled?
Every Jules VM runs Ubuntu Linux and includes many popular developer tools out of the box:
- Node.js
- Bun
- Python
- Go
- Java
- Rust

## Running Tasks

Once you've logged in and connected GitHub, you're ready to start coding with Jules. This guide walks through the key steps of running a task ‚Äî from selecting a repo to writing your prompt and setting up notifications.

### Choose a repo and branch
Jules needs a repo and branch to work on. After logging in:
1. Open the repo selector dropdown
2. Select the repository you'd like Jules to work on
3. Choose the branch you want to base your changes on

Jules remembers your last-used repo, so you'll always see the last used repo in the repo selector.

### Write a clear prompt
Jules works best when your prompt is specific and scoped. Use plain language ‚Äî no need for perfect grammar or code.

#### ‚úÖ Good prompts
- Add a loading spinner while fetchUserProfile runs
- Fix the 500 error while submitting the feedback form
- Document the useCache hook with JSDoc

#### üö´ Avoid
- Fix everything
- Optimize code
- Make this better

If Jules needs more clarity, it will ask for feedback before writing code.

### Watching Jules work
Once the plan is approved, Jules will start coding.

You will see:
- An activity feed as each step completes
- Inline explanations of each change
- A mini diff preview for each file

Use the diff editor for a full view across all files.

### Final summary & branch creation
When Jules finishes a task, it provides a summary of everything it accomplished.

- ‚úÖ Files changed
- ‚è± Total runtime
- ‚ûï Lines of code added/changed/removed
- üåø Option to create branch and commit message

You can click "Create branch" to push the changes. Note that:
- You are the branch owner
- Jules appears as the commit author
- You can open a PR from this branch in GitHub

### Giving feedback mid-task
You can send feedback to Jules while it's working:
- Type directly into the chat box
- Ask Jules to change its approach, revise code, or clarify logic
- Jules will respond and, if needed, replan or revise the task
- You can intervene at any time, you're in control

### Pausing Jules
You can pause Jules at any time by clicking the "pause".

When Jules is paused it won't do any work, and will wait for your next set of instructions. You can prompt it again, unpause it, or delete the task.

### Starting tasks from GitHub Issues
You can start a task from a GitHub issue by applying the label "jules" (case insensitive). Make sure that the Jules GitHub app is authorized to access the repo.

1. Select an issue, then click the gear icon next to "Labels"
2. Add the label "jules" (case insensitive) to the issue
3. Soon, you will see Jules comment automatically on the issue
4. When Jules is finished with the issue, it will provide a link to the pull request where you can review its work

---

## Planning

Once you start a task in Jules, it generates a plan before writing any code. This lets you know the direction Jules will take while it works on the task. From here, you can also iterate with Jules on the plan before any code is written.

### Reviewing the plan
After setup (cloning your repo, initializing the VM, and installing dependencies), Jules will present its plan.

You'll see:
- A natural language description of what Jules intends to direction
- Step-by-step breakdowns
- Any assumptions or setup steps

Open each step by expanding them to read through each one.
Give feedback using the chat input if you need.
Click "approve plan" when you're ready for Jules to begin executing and writing code.

**Note:** If you navigate away, Jules will eventually auto-approve the plan, which is set on a timer. So there is no need to babysit.

### Giving feedback
At any point, you can use the chat box to talk to Jules.
- Ask it to revise a step
- Point out something it missed
- Clarify your original request
- Answer its questions, or provide additional information Jules may need

Jules will respond and update its plan if needed.

---

## Reviewing Code

Once you approve a plan, Jules begins working inside a virtual machine. As it completes steps, you'll see an activity log with Jules' thoughts and code updates. This page walks you through what to look for and how to respond.

### Activity feed
As Jules works, you'll see a real-time activity feed that logs:
- Each step it completes
- Descriptions of what it did
- Any outputs or errors encountered
- Requests for additional information or feedback

This feed gives you insight into Jules' decision-making and progress.

### Code diffs
When Jules changes code, you'll see a mini diff directly in the feed. For a more complete view:
- On the right pane, you can view a full screen expanded diff editor to see all changes across files
- The diff editor only shows files where it modified or added code
- Expand the diff editor to full screen, or drag the left sidebar of the diff editor to slide it to your preferred width
- You can download and copy code that Jules has written from the download and copy icons located in the top right of the diff editor panel. When you copy code, only the updated code will save to your clip board (not the full diff)

This is your central hub for understanding the scope of the changes Jules made to your repo.

### Interactive feedback
You can interact with Jules in real-time through the chat box:
- Ask it to revise logic or naming
- Request additional tests or cleanup
- Give corrections like "return an empty string instead of None"

### Task summary
When the task completes, Jules provides a final summary which includes:
- ‚úÖ Files changed
- ‚è± Total runtime
- ‚ûï Lines of code added/changed
- üåø Branch name and commit message

### Pushing to GitHub
Click "Create branch" to push Jules' changes to GitHub:
- Jules will appear as a commit author on the branch
- If you choose to open a PR, you will be the PR author
- Once pushed, you can continue editing the branch, review it as a GitHub PR, or delete it

---

## Managing Tasks and Repos

To start a new task:
- Click the Jules icon to return to the home screen and a blank prompt input
- Use the + button in the top navigation on the task view
- From within a specific repo view, click new task

You can launch multiple tasks at a time to run them simultaneously. If you are viewing an existing task, or repo page when you kick off a new task, that task will load and begin running in the background. You will have to navigate to the task to check for updates, approve the plan, etc.

Each task runs in its own virtual machine and maintains its own logs, environment setup, and code changes.

### Pausing or deleting tasks
Sometimes you need to stop Jules mid-task or clean up old runs.
- To pause a task: click the pause
- To delete a task: hover over the task in the repo view and click the trash icon

Paused tasks can be resumed later; deleted tasks are removed permanently.

### Managing repositories
Jules can only access repositories you explicitly allow through GitHub. In the future, Jules will work with more version control systems.

#### Selecting a repo
If you've already granted Jules access to all your repos:
- Use the dropdown when starting a task to choose any authorized repo
- Enroll new from the left sidebar
- Search for your repo using the repo selector

#### Granting access to more repos
To give Jules access to more of your repositories:
1. Go to github.com
2. Click your profile photo ‚Äî> settings
3. In the left sidebar, click applications
4. Find Google Labs Jules and click configure
5. Under repository access, select additional repos
6. Click save

You can also authorize new repositories via the repo selector in Jules. Open the repo selector and scroll to the bottom to click on +Add repository. This will take you to GitHub, where you can select additional repositories to grant access for Jules.

---

## Repo View

The repo view gives you a focused workspace for interacting with a specific repository. From here, you can view task history, manage running tasks, and launch features like Codecasts (coming soon).

### Accessing the repo view
There are two ways to open a repo view:
1. Click on any repository name from the sidebar task list
2. Select a repo from the task picker, then click into it after starting a task

This opens a view scoped to that repository, including task history and available actions.

### Viewing tasks by repo
Inside the repo view, you'll see a list of all tasks associated with that repo:
- Running tasks are listed at the top
- Completed tasks include full logs and diffs
- Failed or waiting tasks are clearly labeled

You can click on any task to reopen it, review the plan, or continue feedback.

### Starting a new task
From the repo view, you can start a new task scoped to that repository:
1. Click "new tasks" in the top right corner
2. This will preselect the repo and branch
3. Enter your prompt and optimal setup script as usual

---

## Errors and Failures

Even though Jules automates many parts of the development process, things can go wrong such as environment misconfigurations to task failures. This page covers how Jules reports errors, what it does automatically, and how you can debug issues.

### How errors are reported
Jules surfaces errors in two key places:
- The activity feed, where the step failed is logged
- A notification badge (red dot) in the UI

These errors can show up whether the task has failed completely or simply requires your intervention.

### Automatic retry behavior
Jules will attempt to retry failed steps automatically when possible. For example:
- Network hiccups
- Transient install errors
- Slow dependency resolutions

After multiple retries, if the problem persists, the task will be marked as failed.

### Common causes of failure
The most frequent issues are:
- Incomplete or missing environment setup scripts
- Prompts that are too vague or overly broad
- Repos with unusual or nonstandard build systems
- Long-running processes (like npm run dev) included in setup

### Debugging environment setup
You can retry a task by:
- Clicking rerun from the task summary view
- Modifying your setup script or prompt before restarting the task
- Make sure to address any specific feedback from the failure logs

## FAQ

### What is Jules?
Jules is a software coding agent that helps you fix bugs, add documentation, update your app, and implement new features. It integrates with GitHub and works asynchronously ‚Äî meaning you can submit a task, go do something else, and return when it's done. Jules is currently in Public Beta.

### Is Jules free of charge?
Yes, for now, Jules is free of charge. Jules is in beta and available without payment while we learn from usage. In the future, we expect to introduce pricing, but our focus right now is improving the developer experience.

### How does Jules work under the hood?
Each task runs in a fresh virtual machine where Jules clones your repo, installs dependencies, and makes changes based on your prompt. You can provide setup scripts to ensure your project builds and tests correctly.

### How does Jules run code, and what should I know about security?
When you run code in Jules, it's executed in a secure, cloud-based virtual machine (VM) with internet access. While this gives you powerful tools to test, build, and debug in context, it's important to treat the environment with the same security precautions you would for any public or shared compute surface.

You are responsible for the code you run. That means:
- Don't commit secrets (like API keys, tokens, or credentials) to your repo
- Avoid known security vulnerabilities in your dependencies or scripts
- Be cautious with third-party packages or shell commands that could compromise your system

### Can Jules run long-lived commands like npm run dev?
No. Long-running processes like dev servers or watch scripts aren't currently supported in setup scripts. Use discrete install/test commands instead.

### What languages does Jules support?
Jules is language agnostic but works best with projects that use:
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- Python
- Go
- Java
- Rust

Support depends on what's installed on the VM and the clarity of your environment setup script.

### Can I leave Jules while its working?
Yes! Jules is designed to be asynchronous. You can leave the app after submitting a task. Make sure to enable notifications so you'll be alerted when a plan is ready or a task completes.

### How do I provide feedback or report a bug?
Click the feedback button in the bottom left of the Jules UI. No account or tracking system required ‚Äî feedback goes straight to the team.

### What happens if a task fails?
Jules will retry automatically. If it continues to fail, it will mark the task as failed and notify you. Common causes include broken setup scripts or vague prompts.

You can revise and rerun the task once you've addressed the issue.

### How many tasks can I run?
- 5 concurrent tasks
- 60 total tasks per day

### Can I change which repos Jules has access to?
Yes. Go to your GitHub settings:
1. Click your profile ‚Äî> settings
2. Select applications in the sidebar
3. Find Google Labs Jules and click configure
4. Adjust repository access
5. Then refresh Jules and your new repos will appear

### Does Jules train on private repos?
No. Jules does not train on private repository content. Privacy is a core principle for Jules, and we do not use your private repositories to train models.
