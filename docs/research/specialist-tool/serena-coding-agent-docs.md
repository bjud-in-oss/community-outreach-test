**Status:** Complete Serena documentation with capabilities and integration options

# Serena - Powerful Coding Agent Toolkit

## Overview

ðŸš€ Serena is a powerful **coding agent toolkit** capable of turning an LLM into a fully-featured agent that works **directly on your codebase**. Unlike most other tools, it is not tied to an LLM, framework or an interface, making it easy to use it in a variety of ways.

ðŸ”§ Serena provides essential **semantic code retrieval and editing tools** that are akin to an IDE's capabilities, extracting code entities at the symbol level and exploiting relational structure. When combined with an existing coding agent, these tools greatly enhance (token) efficiency.

ðŸ†“ Serena is **free & open-source**, enhancing the capabilities of LLMs you already have access to free of charge.

## Key Features

### Semantic Code Analysis
- **Symbol-level code extraction** - Understands code at function/class level
- **Relational structure exploitation** - Sees connections between code entities
- **IDE-like capabilities** - Provides semantic understanding similar to modern IDEs
- **Token efficiency** - Retrieves only relevant code, saving 80-90% tokens

### LLM Integration Options
Serena can be integrated with an LLM in several ways:

#### Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- **Claude Code and Claude Desktop** - Direct integration
- **Terminal-based clients** - Codex, Gemini-CLI, Qwen3-Coder, rovodev, OpenHands CLI
- **IDEs** - VSCode, Cursor, IntelliJ
- **Extensions** - Cline, Roo Code
- **Local clients** - OpenWebUI, Jan, Agno

#### Other Integration Methods
- **mcpo** - Connect to ChatGPT and other non-MCP clients
- **Agent frameworks** - Incorporate into custom agent frameworks
- **Library usage** - Use as a library for building applications

### Programming Language Support

#### Direct Out-of-the-Box Support:
- **Python** - Full support
- **TypeScript/JavaScript** - Full support
- **PHP** - Full support
- **Go** - Requires gopls installation
- **Rust** - Full support
- **C#** - Full support
- **Ruby** - Full support
- **Swift** - Full support
- **Java** - Slow startup, potential macOS/Linux issues
- **Elixir** - Requires NextLS and Elixir install, Windows not supported
- **Clojure** - Full support
- **Bash** - Full support
- **C/C++** - May have issues with finding references

#### Indirect Support (May Require Manual Setup):

- **Dart** - Untested

## Installation and Usage

### Requirements
- **uv** - Package manager (must be installed)
- **Language servers** - For specific language support
- **Node.js >= v18.0.0** - For certain integrations

### Installation Methods

#### Using uvx (Recommended)
```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/oraios/serena serena start-mcp-server
```

#### Local Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/oraios/serena
cd serena
uv run serena config edit  # Optional configuration
uv run serena start-mcp-server
```

#### Docker (Experimental)
Docker support is available but experimental with several limitations.

### Configuration
- **Config file** - Located in home directory
- **Command-line arguments** - Various customization options
- **Dashboard** - Web-based dashboard on localhost for logs and control

## Integration Examples

### Claude Code Integration
One-line shell command to supercharge Claude Code performance with semantic code understanding.

### Claude Desktop Integration
Direct MCP server integration for enhanced coding capabilities.

### Custom Agent Framework Integration
Serena's tools can be incorporated into any agent framework, with implementation decoupled from framework-specific code.

## Technical Architecture

### Language Server Protocol (LSP)
- **Foundation** - Built on widely implemented LSP
- **Versatile capabilities** - Code querying and editing based on symbolic understanding
- **IDE-like functionality** - Discovers and edits code like a seasoned developer
- **Scalability** - Works efficiently even in very large and complex projects

### Semantic Analysis Capabilities
- **Symbol extraction** - Finds specific functions, classes, variables
- **Relationship mapping** - Understands code dependencies and connections
- **Context-aware editing** - Makes precise changes based on code understanding
- **Efficient retrieval** - Only fetches relevant code sections

## Performance Benefits

### Token Efficiency
- **80-90% token savings** - Retrieves only relevant code instead of entire files
- **Cost reduction** - Dramatically lower LLM API costs
- **Quality improvement** - Better results from focused context

### Code Quality
- **Precise editing** - Makes exact changes to specific symbols
- **Relationship awareness** - Understands impact on other code parts
- **IDE-level understanding** - Semantic analysis prevents random changes

## Limitations and Considerations

### Technical Limitations
- **Java performance** - Slow startup, especially initial startup
- **Platform issues** - Some languages have problems on specific platforms
- **Language server dependencies** - Requires external language servers
- **Memory usage** - Language servers can be memory intensive

### Complexity Considerations
- **Setup complexity** - Requires configuration and dependencies
- **Debugging difficulty** - Multiple layers can complicate troubleshooting
- **Maintenance overhead** - Additional component to maintain and update

## Use Cases

### Ideal For:
- **Large codebases** - Where semantic understanding provides significant value
- **Token optimization** - Projects where LLM costs are a concern
- **Precise code editing** - When exact changes are critical
- **Multi-language projects** - Leveraging broad language support

### Consider Alternatives For:
- **Simple projects** - Where overhead may not be justified
- **Prototype development** - Where speed is more important than precision
- **Resource-constrained environments** - Where additional dependencies are problematic

## Development Status
- **Active development** - Regular updates and improvements
- **Open source** - Free to use and modify
- **Community driven** - Contributions and feedback welcome
- **Experimental features** - Some features like Docker support are still experimental
