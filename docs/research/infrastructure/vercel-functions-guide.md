# Vercel Functions Guide

Vercel Functions lets you run server-side code without managing servers. They adapt automatically to user demand, handle connections to APIs and databases, and offer enhanced concurrency through fluid compute, which is useful for AI workloads or any I/O-bound tasks that require efficient scaling.

When you deploy your application, Vercel automatically sets up the tools and optimizations for your chosen framework. It ensures low latency by routing traffic through Vercel's Edge Network, and placing your functions in a specific region when you need more control over data locality.

## Quick Start

To get started with creating your first function:

```typescript
export function GET(request: Request) {
  return new Response('Hello from Vercel!');
}
```

## Key Features

### Automatic Scaling
- Functions adapt automatically to user demand
- Scale down to zero when there are no incoming requests
- Handle traffic spikes without manual intervention

### Fluid Compute
- Enhanced concurrency for AI workloads and I/O-bound tasks
- Reuses function instances to optimize performance and cost
- Reduces cold starts and lowers latency
- Concurrent execution within the same instance

### Regional Deployment
- Functions run in a single region by default
- Can be configured to run in multiple regions for globally replicated data
- Default region: Washington, D.C., USA (`iad1`)
- Functions execute close to data sources to reduce latency

### Performance Optimization
- Vercel creates new function invocation for each request
- Reuses same function instance for subsequent requests
- Optimized concurrency model prevents spinning up multiple isolated instances
- Efficient handling of tasks that spend time waiting for external operations

## Configuration

### Setting Region
You can set a new region through your project's settings on Vercel to optimize for data locality.

### Monitoring
View performance and cost efficiency metrics using Vercel Observability:

1. Choose your project from the dashboard
2. Click on the Observability tab and select Vercel Functions section
3. Click chevron icon to expand and see all charts

Available metrics:
- Total consumed and saved GB-Hours
- Ratio of saved usage
- Cost savings from optimized concurrency model (with fluid compute)

## Pricing

Vercel Functions are priced based on:
- Active CPU usage
- Provisioned memory
- Number of invocations

With fluid compute enabled, you benefit from cost savings through the optimized concurrency model.

## Use Cases

Perfect for:
- AI workloads requiring efficient scaling
- I/O-bound tasks with external API calls
- Authentication handling
- Data streaming
- Database queries
- Serverless backend APIs

## Integration with AI Workloads

Vercel Functions are particularly well-suited for AI applications due to:
- Fluid compute optimization for concurrent processing
- Automatic scaling for variable AI workload demands
- Reduced cold starts for better user experience
- Cost efficiency for intermittent AI processing tasks
